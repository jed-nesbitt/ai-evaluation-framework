VerifAI — AI-Enhanced Critical Thinking for Education (Prototype)

VerifAI is an AI-powered educational tool designed to help students improve their critical thinking, source evaluation, and reasoning skills when interacting with AI-generated content. Built as part of an academic project in AI in Education, VerifAI acts as a lightweight prototype demonstrating how AI can guide learners toward more reflective and responsible use of generative technologies.

🚀 Project Overview

Generative AI is transforming how students study, write, and solve problems—but it also introduces new risks: hallucinations, superficial answers, and reduced critical engagement.
VerifAI aims to address this gap by prompting students to question, analyse, and verify the information they receive.

This prototype currently supports:

🧠 Critical thinking prompts

🔍 Bias, accuracy, and evidence checks

⚖️ Comparisons of alternative viewpoints

✏️ Guided reflection questions

📘 Education-focused UI for quick, classroom-friendly use

📂 Features
✔️ AI Critical Thinking Prompts

Automatically generates questions that encourage deeper reasoning:

“What assumptions is the model making?”

“Is there evidence supporting this claim?”

“What alternative interpretation may exist?”

✔️ Chrome-Extension Style Workflow (Prototype)

Designed to integrate seamlessly with browsing or text-generation tools.

✔️ Lightweight Python Backend

Minimal, readable structure so educators and researchers can easily extend it.

✔️ Configurable Prompt Templates

Educators can adjust:

Level of difficulty

Prompt style

Instruction focus areas
